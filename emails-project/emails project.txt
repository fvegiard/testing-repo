## ⚠️ What Could NOT Be Completed

 

### Limitations Encountered:

 

#### 1. **Outlook Web Interface Automation**

- **Issue:** Desktop Commander tools cannot directly interact with web browser interfaces

- **Impact:** Unable to automatically:

  - Open and navigate Outlook 365 inbox

  - Click download buttons for PDF attachments

  - Flag/mark emails as "Marquer comme terminé" (Mark as complete)

  - Identify new unprocessed invoice emails

 

#### 2. **Email Flagging**

- **Status:** ❌ Not completed

- **Reason:** Requires browser automation tools (Selenium, Playwright) or Outlook API integration

- **Recommendation:** Manual flagging or use alternative automation approach

## 🔧 Technical Details

 

### PowerShell Commands Used:

```powershell

# Move invoice PDFs matching patterns

$sourceDir = "C:\Users\DRsac.DRELECTRIQUE\Downloads"

$destDir = "C:\Users\DRsac.DRELECTRIQUE\dev\claude\emails"

Get-ChildItem -Path $sourceDir -Filter "*.pdf" |

Where-Object { $_.Name -match "^(fact|Fact|facture|Facture|IN\d+|Inv\d+|S-\d+|doc\d+)" } |

ForEach-Object {

    Move-Item -Path $_.FullName -Destination $destDir -Force

    Write-Host "Moved: $($_.Name)"

}

```

 

### File Matching Patterns:

- `fact*` or `Fact*` - French invoices (factures)

- `facture*` or `Facture*` - French invoices

- `IN\d+` - Invoice numbers starting with IN

- `Inv\d+` - Invoice numbers starting with Inv

- `S-\d+` - Service order documents

- `doc\d+` - Scanned documents with date stamps

## 📋 Recommendations for Complete Automation

 

To achieve full automation as originally requested, consider:

 

### Option 1: Browser Automation (Recommended)

Install and configure:

- **Selenium WebDriver** or **Playwright**

- Create Python/PowerShell script to:

  - Navigate to Outlook 365 web interface

  - Search for invoice emails

  - Download PDF attachments

  - Flag processed emails

  - Run periodically via Task Scheduler

 

### Option 2: Microsoft Graph API

- Use Microsoft Graph API for programmatic Outlook access

- Requires Azure AD app registration and OAuth authentication

- More reliable and maintainable than web scraping

- Can directly access attachments without browser interaction

 

### Option 3: Outlook Desktop Client

If Outlook desktop client is installed:

- Use PowerShell with Outlook COM objects

- Direct integration without browser automation

- More stable than web interface automation

 

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach

- Continue manual download of PDFs from Outlook

- Use this automated file organization script (already working)

- Manually flag emails (or implement flagging later)
